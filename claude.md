You are making a beautiful mobile-first website that sparks joy for use at a wedding.

The concept is that each table at the wedding is a place that the couple has lived in. Users will find codes
at the real life tables that allow them to check in at that location on the website.

While developing this site it is important to write clean, reusable code and to make sure we pass linter
rules. Also please conform with the style guide in STYLE.md and that tests still pass

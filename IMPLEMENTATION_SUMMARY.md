# Implementation Summary: Issue #28 - Meeple Viewing Experience Improvements

This document summarizes the implementation of improvements to handle 131+ guests viewing meeples on the wedding map.

## Problem Statement

With 131 guests, the meeple viewing experience degraded significantly:
1. **Message Tracking**: No way to track which messages users have already read
2. **Visual Crowding**: All meeples rendered on top of each other in a tight circle
3. **Discernibility**: Impossible to distinguish individual meeples

## Solution Overview

Implemented a two-phase approach:
- **Phase 1**: Message read tracking with visual indicators
- **Phase 2**: Spatial distribution improvements with smart z-indexing

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes

**New Table: `message_reads`**
- Tracks which check-in messages each user has read
- Location: `supabase-migrations/001-add-message-reads-table.sql`
- Features:
  - Unique constraint prevents duplicate reads
  - Automatic trigger marks messages as unread when edited
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user privacy

**Updated Schema**:
- Added `meeple_style` and `current_location_id` fields to `user_preferences` table in base schema

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase-schema.sql` - Updated user_preferences table definition
- `src/types/database.ts` - Added TypeScript types for message_reads table

### 2. API Changes

**New Endpoint: `/api/message-reads`**
- Location: `src/app/api/message-reads/route.ts`
- **GET**: Fetch all checkin IDs that the current user has read
- **POST**: Mark a checkin message as read by the current user
- Features:
  - Authentication required
  - Optimistic UI updates
  - Handles duplicate reads gracefully

### 3. Frontend Changes

**WeddingMap Component** (`src/components/WeddingMap.tsx`):

**a) Message Read Tracking**:
- Added state to track read checkin IDs
- Fetches read status on mount for logged-in users
- New helper functions:
  - `markMessageAsRead()` - Marks message as read with optimistic UI update
  - `isUnreadMessage()` - Checks if a message is unread for the current user
- Auto-marks messages as read when meeple is clicked

**b) Improved Meeple Positioning**:
- Changed `getMeeplePosition()` function from exact circle to distributed circular area
- Uses deterministic pseudo-random distribution based on index
- Employs polar coordinates with uniform distribution
- Maintains consistency across renders

**c) Visual Feedback for Unread Messages**:
- Added golden glow animation for unread meeples
- Implemented z-index logic to bring unread meeples to the front (z-index: 1000)
- Users don't see their own messages as "unread"

**d) CSS Animations** (`src/app/globals.css`):
- New `@keyframes unreadGlow` animation
- Pulsing golden glow effect (rgba(245, 158, 11))
- 2-second infinite ease-in-out animation

### 4. User Experience Improvements

**Before**:
- All 131 meeples in exact circle
- No way to track read/unread messages
- Meeples rendered on top of each other
- Hard to distinguish individual meeples

**After**:
- Meeples distributed within circular area (less crowding)
- Unread messages have golden glow
- Unread meeples appear on top (higher z-index)
- Click on meeple to mark message as read
- Edited messages automatically marked as unread

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open `supabase-migrations/001-add-message-reads-table.sql`
3. Copy and paste the entire contents
4. Click "Run" to execute

See `supabase-migrations/README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improve meeple viewing experience for 131+ guests (#28)"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Vercel will automatically deploy the changes
```

### Step 3: Verify

1. Test with multiple users viewing the same location
2. Verify unread messages have golden glow
3. Click on meeples to mark as read
4. Edit a message and verify it becomes unread again
5. Check that meeples are distributed within circular area

## Technical Details

### Meeple Distribution Algorithm

The new `getMeeplePosition()` function uses:
- **Deterministic pseudo-random**: Based on index for consistency
- **Uniform distribution**: Uses sqrt(rand) for radius to ensure even distribution
- **Polar coordinates**: Converts to lat/lon offsets

Formula:
```javascript
r = √(random1)              // Distance from center (0 to 1)
θ = random2 × 2π           // Angle (0 to 2π)
lat = centerLat + (radius × r × cos(θ))
lon = centerLon + (radius × r × sin(θ))
```

### Read Tracking Logic

1. **On Mount**: Fetch all read checkin IDs for current user
2. **On Meeple Click**:
   - Check if message is unread
   - If unread, call API to mark as read
   - Optimistically update UI
   - Revert on error
3. **On Message Edit**:
   - Database trigger deletes all read records for that checkin
   - All users see the message as "unread" again

### Z-Index Strategy

- **Unread meeples**: z-index = 1000 (appears on top)
- **Read meeples**: z-index = 1 (normal layer)
- This ensures unread messages are always visible and clickable

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Read Tracking**:
   - Create multiple users
   - Have them check in with messages
   - Verify each user sees others' messages as unread (glowing)
   - Click on meeple and verify glow disappears
   - Edit a message and verify it glows again for all users

2. **Spatial Distribution**:
   - Check in 10-20 users at same location
   - Verify meeples are spread out (not in perfect circle)
   - Zoom in and verify they're distributed within circular area
   - Check that distribution is consistent across page refreshes

3. **Large Scale**:
   - Test with 131 users (the actual wedding guest count)
   - Verify performance is acceptable
   - Check that unread meeples are easily visible
   - Ensure clicking works even with many overlapping meeples

### Automated Testing

Consider adding tests for:
- API endpoints (`/api/message-reads`)
- Read tracking logic in WeddingMap
- Meeple position calculation consistency

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The issue mentioned an alternative "grouping" approach for very high densities:
- Group meeples together when they reach certain density
- Show group avatar with count
- Allow "ungrouping" to view individual messages

This was deemed unnecessary for now since the distributed positioning approach should handle 131 guests adequately. Can be revisited if needed.

## Files Changed

### New Files:
- `supabase-migrations/001-add-message-reads-table.sql`
- `supabase-migrations/README.md`
- `src/app/api/message-reads/route.ts`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified Files:
- `supabase-schema.sql`
- `src/types/database.ts`
- `src/components/WeddingMap.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`

## Performance Considerations

- **Database**: Indexes added on `message_reads` for fast queries
- **API**: Optimistic UI updates reduce perceived latency
- **Frontend**: Read status fetched once on mount, then managed locally
- **Rendering**: Z-index changes don't trigger layout recalculation

## Accessibility

- Glow effect provides visual feedback
- Z-index ensures unread messages are clickable
- Works with existing touch/click handlers
- No changes to screen reader experience (messages still readable via popup)
